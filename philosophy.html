					<h2>Real-Time Updates</h2>
					<p>Our team is ideating a system of sensors that collect real-time data, presenting it through visual display and installed artwork throughout the house. These panels around the home would allow the homeowners to adjust temperatures, lighting, and other critical home controls, while receiving feed-back on their energy and water consumption.</p>

					<h2>Solar People</h2>
					<p>Finally, to stay consistent with our motto of creating not just solar homes, but solar people, we&rsquo;ve formed a team of interaction designers out of Stanford&rsquo;s Hasso Plattner Institute of Design to re- engineer how homeowners interact with basic daily tasks, such as using the bathroom or turning on a light which. The process of developing these devices will begin with need-finding missions across campus, speaking with local homeowners about daily behavior within the home, and then prototyping and developing devices to gently educate homeowners about hoe to live more sustainably.</p>

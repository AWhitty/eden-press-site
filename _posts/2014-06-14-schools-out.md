With the school year bleeding into early June, all of our students were anxious to get out of the class, but not for the reason you’d expect: they wanted to get working!

Solar Decathlon was a three-unit study option during the spring quarter, but for most of us it was not satisfying enough. Fourteen students received research grants to continue their efforts through the summer quarter and are excited to dive right in. The effort is interdisciplinary and will challenge students from different backgrounds to work together for 40 hours a week towards a common goal. We can’t wait to see what the SURIs (Stanford Undergraduate Research Interns) develop over the summer.

If you're reading this post, it means you should probably spend a little time learning about how to edit content on this site. The site is powered by a thing called [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), and its source code is hosted on [Github](http://github.com).

Modifying the site can be simple and it can be painful. It really depends on how much crap you're willing to wade through.

- Modifying smalls bits of text, adding blog posts = easy.
- Changing images = moderate.
- Uploading images = moderately hard.
- Modifying layouts or creating pages = hard.

It's a little late, so to save myself some time and to frustrate myself down the road, I'm going to skip explaining how to do those things for now (I had some bold aspirations about ten minutes ago when I started writing this). Instead, I hope that you, the intrepid Solar D press kid, just get in touch with me when you need to change out the fake, crappy content on this site with real images and text. Sawyer and I can only do so much to write copy.

I _strongly_ urge you to take a look at every image and bit of text on this site to make a detailed list of things that need to be corrected before the site goes live. For one, these blog posts have to go. The content on the design philosophy page sounds pretty disconnected too. The team members page needs to be updated or hidden. The sponsors page might be okay? It's your call. I have a feeling that pictures of Big Sur and LA aren't exactly the most relevant content even if they're pretty. But please keep in mind, I do not have time to make substantial changes to layout or site behavior unless they are _extremely_ pressing. Instead, please only focus on the content of the text and images to make sure everything is saying exactly what you want it to say.

To fill out the media gallery, please send me fairly decent resolution images to load it up. If you want to skip that for now, we can just hide the page. Or we can have 50 copies of Larry's face.

Also, feel free to test the site on all the devices you can and make a good list of any issues that come up regarding cross-device compatibility. I won't be able to sort through these issues quickly, but I at least want to know about them (no, I don't really, but I should).

Thanks,

Austin

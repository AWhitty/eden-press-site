This week is the end of the SURI chapter, and the beginning of the year, as well as Stanford Football.

The 10 weeks of SURI has been an unbelievable learning experience on and off the job. Every student faced challenges with work as well as with the dynamics of a work environment. Some students were pulled out of their comfort zone and some chose to explore that space as a chance to grow.

Every SURI logged much more than the expected 40 hours in a week because of their passion, drive, and insatiable need to create. It was a pleasure to work on the SURI team and I know all of us have grown in our experiences, knowledge, and social maturity more than in any other summer. We had Product Design majors learn architecture basics, meet with structural engineers, and dive into the world of business development. We had Mechanical Engineers learn how HVAC and Solar systems work in a home, as well plumbing and grey water recovery. We had Electrical Engineers learning how to wire a home for light fixtures, outlets, and appliances.

We are excited to dive back into the school year with 40 students joining the team and giving the SURIs more support.

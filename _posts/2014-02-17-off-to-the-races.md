We have officially been accepted to the Solar Decathlon 2015!

We could not be more excited, and we are off to the races. There was a lot of work done to make the application submission ready, and we couldnâ€™t help but get a little ahead of ourselves before we heard the good news. Everyone was holding their breath through January, and now there is a large relaxed exhale, and an immediate excited breath for what we can accomplish. We will check in on our progress with this blog and hope to keep it updated quite frequently.

Stay tuned Solar Fans.

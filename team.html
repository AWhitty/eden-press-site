      <h2>Solar People</h2>

      <p class="prose">To stay consistent with our motto of creating not just solar homes, but solar people, we&rsquo;ve formed a team of interaction designers out of Stanford&rsquo;s Hasso Plattner Institute of Design to re- engineer how homeowners interact with basic daily tasks, such as using the bathroom or turning on a light which. The process of developing these devices will begin with need-finding missions across campus, speaking with local homeowners about daily behavior within the home, and then prototyping and developing devices to gently educate homeowners about hoe to live more sustainably.</p>

        <h3>Why Support Us</h3>
        <p>We urge you to support Stanford students in creating an innovative design of the modern home.
      In order to accomplish our goals, we will need the support of companies and people who share the same visions of a brighter tomorrow. As one of our team sponsors, you will receive not only public recognition on our website and our construction and competition sites, but you will also have the opportunity to form personal relationships with the student team and its members. With the excitement and publicity generated by Stanford, we will create a home that serves as a model and inspiration for Silicon Valley and beyond.</p>
